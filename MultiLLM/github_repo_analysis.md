## GitHub Repository Analysis - Initial Observations

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- `.claude/commands`: Likely contains commands related to Claude.
- `Examples`: Contains examples of how to use the orchestrator.
- `__pycache__`: Python cache directory.
- `CLAUDE.md`: Mentions agent behavior instructions in the development plan.
- `LEARNINGS.md`: Mentions accumulated knowledge base in the development plan.
- `Orchestrator.png`: An image related to the orchestrator.
- `README.md`: The main README file, which I have already extracted.
- `next_check_note.txt`: A text file, purpose unclear without further investigation.
- `schedule_with_note.sh`: Shell script for self-scheduling functionality.
- `send-claude-message.sh`: Shell script for simplified agent communication, specifically mentioned in the development plan as needing refactoring.
- `tmux_utils.py`: Python utilities for Tmux interaction.

The project is primarily written in Python (80.5%) and Shell (19.5%).

From the `README.md` and the development plan, the core components for LLM interaction appear to be `send-claude-message.sh` and potentially `tmux_utils.py` for handling Tmux interactions that might involve sending messages to agents.
